    "Linear Discrimant Analysis performed the best in the publications. Since this is a very well established problem, almost all methods that I have performed was already performed by other researchers. So, the results are very similiar because of that. I can definitely improve my methods using the tecniques implemented in the literature. For instance, I can use bootstrap sampling for evaluating just like in the first article or I could take advantage of principle component analysis. I could also optimize the parameters of linear discriminant analysis which gives a fairly good accuracy."
